# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

### Purpose

Pewlett-Hackard management is expecting a wave of retirements in the near future, and they need additional data to prepare. Management would like to implement a mentorship program to transition the future retirees into a part time/consulting role mentoring newer employees, and they need data regarding the number of potential retirees, their roles, and if they are eligible to be a mentor.  


 ## Results

After the deliverables were completed, it was determined that:

* Pewlett-Hackard is on the verge of nearly 1/3 (90,399) of their 300k employees reaching retirement eligibility soon. 
* Roughly half (45,397) of the potential retirees have engineering titles.
* Management is likely the least impacted by the "Silver Tsunami", with only 2 of 24 managers eligible to retire.
* Only 1550 of the potential retirees are eligible for the mentorship program


## Summary

Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill slighty more than 90k roles over the next few years as 30% of their current staff prepares to retire. With only 1500 retirees eligible for their mentorship program, management may want to broaden the retiree eligibilty requirements for the program for it to be successful. 

As it stands currently, only 748 of the 45,397 retiring engineering employees are eligible for the mentorship program, the Production and Development departments may experience a "brain drain" effect from losing thousands of experienced, higher ranking engineers.

This chart displays the roles each department is expected to lose in the "Silver Tsunami". One recommendation would be to broaden the available mentors by including more senior staff by title instead of birth year. 

Please note that per the requirements the first deliverable queried the number of retirement eligible employees in total from the employees chart, it does not take into account employees that have already left the company. This chart is based on current employees, therefore the numbers may be different.
